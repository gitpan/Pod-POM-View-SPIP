Installing Pod::POM::View::SPIP
===============================

Pod::POM::View::SPIP is a view for Pod::POM to translate POD text
into SPIP markup.

To install the pom2spip script, simply run the following commands
(where x.xx is the current script version):

    $ tar xvzf Pod-POM-View-SPIP-x.xx.tar.gz
    $ cd Pod-POM-View-SPIP-x.xx
    $ perl Makefile.PL

and as root:

    # make install

If you are used to the CPAN way of doing things, the procedure is the
same as always:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    # make install

To run the tests, you just need Pod::POM and Pod::POM::View::SPIP.
