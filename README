README file for Pod::POM::View::SPIP
------------------------------------

SPIP is a popular CMS in France.

This view for Pod::POM permits to translate Pod text into SPIP markup,
in order to publish some articles, written in Pod, on a SPIP intranet.

There are still some glitches (I should improve and think about more
tests), the one known are documented in Pod::POM::View::SPIP(3pm).

This module obviously requires Pod::POM.
